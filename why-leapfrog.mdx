Leapfrog is a qualitative research platform that empowers you to analyze and understand your data at scale.

Since that LLMs came into the scene we've seen a shift in how we can use AI to accelerate research. We believe that AI will fundamentally change how we do research, and we're excited to be a part of this movement.

LLMs allow us to vectorize text and give dimensionality to qualitative data. This gives us the opportunity to consider natural language as a multi-dimensional object, which can in turn be analyzed with traditional quantative research methods. This, combined with AI's ability to filter through noise and its speed, gives qualitative research the ability to understand their data at scale.

Leapfrog is not meant to be a replacement, but rather an enhancement to the traditional process. It reduces the time we spend on trying to understand our user interviews, focus groups or usability tests, and instead allows us to do more of it.
