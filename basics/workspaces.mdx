Leapfrog offers **workspaces** to help you organize your research documents, codes, and quotations. Workspaces can either be **personal** or **shared**, allowing for flexible collaboration within teams or individual use.

## Types of Workspaces

### Personal Workspaces

Personal workspaces are private and not shareable with others. Everything you create, such as documents, codes, and quotations, will remain accessible only to you.

### Shared Workspaces

Shared workspaces allow you to collaborate with others. Codes, quotations, and documents created in shared workspaces can be accessed and edited by other team members who have been given access.

## Workspace Contents

Each workspace contains **Documents** and **Canvasses**:

- **Documents**: Where you create, transcribe, and analyze your text-based data.
- **Canvasses**: Visual spaces where you can brainstorm or map out relationships between different pieces of information.

### Favoriting Items

You can **favorite** documents or canvasses by marking them as favorites, making them easier to find and access later.

## Creating and Editing workspaces

To create a new workspace, use the **workspace switcher** and select the option to **Create New Workspace**.

## Workspace Settings

To access workspace settings, click on the **workspace switcher** in the top-left corner. From the **settings menu**, you can:

- **Rename** your workspace.
- **Delete** your workspace.
- **Share** your workspace with others (if itâ€™s a shared workspace).
- **Enable integrations** to connect with other tools or services.

### Documents

In you documents settings you can manage your documents in your workspace. You can manage document fields here. Read more about document fields [here](/basics/document-editor).

### Integrations

You can find integrations within the **workspace settings**. These allow you to connect Leapfrog with other tools to streamline your research process. Simply go to the workspace switcher, open the settings for the current workspace, and enable the necessary integrations.

### Sharing

In your workspace settings you can share your workspace with others. This will allow you to collaborate with others in real time. You can invite collaborators by email. They will receive an invitation to join your workspace.
