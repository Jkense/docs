This guide will walk you through the process of transcribing audio and video clips in Leapfrog and how to effectively use transcripts in your research projects.

## Prerequisites

- An active Leapfrog workspace.
- An audio or video file ready for transcription.

## Step 1: Create a New Document

To begin, create a new document in your Leapfrog workspace:

![Create a new document](/images/transcribing-interviews/create-document.svg)

1. Open your workspace in the Leapfrog web app.
2. Click the **New Document** button located in the top right corner of your screen.
3. Name your document and confirm. You will be automatically redirected to the document's page.

Now you are ready to start adding media files for transcription.

## Step 2: Upload Audio or Video Files

To add media files, use the toolbar in the document editor:

![Add a new transcript](/images/transcribing-interviews/insert-transcript.svg)

1. In the document editor, click **Upload audio or video to get started**.
2. Choose the audio or video file you want to upload from your computer.
3. Wait for the upload to complete. Once the file is uploaded, you’ll see a button to start the transcription.

## Step 3: Start the Transcription

1. Click the **Transcribe** button to begin the transcription process.
2. Configure your transcription settings. You can customize the following options:
   - **Redaction**: Automatically redact sensitive information, such as names or addresses.
   - **Exclude filler words**: Remove common filler words like "uh," "um," and "mhmm" to produce a cleaner transcript.
   - **Language selection**: Choose the language of the audio or video file for transcription. You can manually select a language or use **Autoselect** to detect it automatically.

### Supported Languages

Leapfrog supports transcription in the following languages:

en, zh, de, es, ru, ko, fr, ja, pt, tr, pl, ca, nl, ar, sv, it, id, hi, fi, vi, he, uk, el, ms, cs, ro, da, hu, ta, no, th, ur, hr, bg, lt, la, mi, ml, cy, sk, te, fa, lv, bn, sr, az, sl, kn, et, mk, br, eu, is, hy, ne, mn, bs, kk, sq, sw, gl, mr, pa, si, km, sn, yo, so, af, oc, ka, be, tg, sd, gu, am, yi, lo, uz, fo, ht, ps, tk, nn, mt, sa, lb, my, bo, tl, mg, as, tt, haw, ln, ha, ba, jw, su.

## Model Size Selection

You can also select different model sizes based on your needs. Leapfrog offers multiple models for transcription, ranging from smaller and faster to larger and more accurate:

- **tiny**: Contains 39M parameters, the smallest and fastest model.
- **base**: Contains 74M parameters.
- **small**: Contains 244M parameters.
- **medium**: Contains 769M parameters. This is the default model.
- **large**: Contains 1550M parameters. The most accurate model available, using OpenAI’s Whisper large-v2 as its default.

## Supported File Types

Leapfrog supports the following file formats for audio and video transcription:

- **Video**: .mp4, .webm, .ogv, .avi, .mov, .mkv
- **Audio**: .mp3, .wav, .ogg, .aac, .webm, .flac

### Example of Redaction

Here’s an example of how redaction might work in a transcript:

| **Original**                                             | **Redacted**                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| "Hi, my name is Jane Doe and I live at 123 Main Street." | "Hi, my name is [NAME_1] and I live at [LOCATION_1]." |
| "My bank account number is 1234567890."                  | "My bank account number is [ACCOUNT_NUMBER_1]."       |
| "You can contact me at john.doe@example.com."            | "You can contact me at [EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]."            |

Leapfrog automatically identifies and redacts sensitive personal information to protect privacy.

## Step 4: Configure Filler Words

**Filler words**—such as "uh" and "um"—are common in spoken language, but can clutter transcripts. You can choose to either include or exclude these filler words from your transcription.

### What Are Filler Words?

Filler words are non-essential phrases that people often use in conversation to pause or think aloud. Common filler words include:

- uh
- um
- mhmm
- uh-huh

You can customize your transcription process to either keep these words for a more natural flow or remove them for a cleaner result.

### Example with and without Filler Words

| **Original**                                                                   | **With Filler Words**                                                          | **Without Filler Words**                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Uh, so you're looking for, uh, something specific, um, like a precise model." | "Uh, so you're looking for, uh, something specific, um, like a precise model." | "So you're looking for something specific, like a precise model." |

To adjust filler word settings:

1. Enable **Filler Words** to keep them in the transcript.
2. Disable **Filler Words** to remove them and improve readability.

## Additional Options: Language Selection

Leapfrog allows you to transcribe audio or video in multiple languages. Simply choose the language in the transcription settings or enable the **Autoselect** option to detect the language automatically.

## What’s Next?

Once your transcription is complete, you can start analyzing the data by:

- **Tagging and coding** the transcript to identify key themes and patterns.
- **Collaborating with your team** to refine your insights.
