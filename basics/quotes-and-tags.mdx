In Leapfrog you can add quotations and tags to your documents. This allows you to label specific segments of your research for deeper analysis.

## Quoting and tagging workflow

Leapfrog is inspired by the [grounded theory approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) to qualitative research. This approach emphasizes the importance of analyzing data in a way that is meaningful and relevant to the research question.

Quoting and tagging is a way to label the most interesting parts of your research data. This allows you to easily extract and analyze this data in later stages of research. It is a way to reduce the cognitive load of working with large amounts of data.

### Quotations

Quotations are a way to label specific segments of your research for deeper analysis. You can add quotations to your documents by selecting text and clicking the **quotation button** in the toolbar.

### Tags

Tags are a way to label specific segments of your research for deeper analysis. You can add tags to your documents by selecting text and clicking the **tag button** in the toolbar. Each tag has a color and a name. You can add multiple quotes to one tag. These will function as a 'bucket' for your quotes. This allows you to easily group and analyze related information in later stages of research.

## Codes

Your codes are all your quotes and tags combined. You codes are stored on a workspace level, and are therefore accessible across all documents in your workspace. You can get an overview of all your codes in the **codes page**. Here you can see all your codes, and get statistics on how many times they appear in your data.
