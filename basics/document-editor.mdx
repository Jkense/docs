# Document Editor

The **Document Editor** in Leapfrog is a powerful tool designed to help you organize, analyze, and collaborate on your research. Whether you’re transcribing interviews, taking notes, or coding data, the editor provides a flexible and collaborative environment for your work.

## Key Features

### 1. Collaborative Editing

Leapfrog’s document editor is fully **collaborative**, allowing multiple users to work together in real time. You and your team can write, edit, and annotate documents simultaneously. Any changes are instantly visible to all collaborators, streamlining teamwork and enabling productive collaboration.

### 2. Add Transcripts with the Waveform Button

One of the standout features of the editor is the ability to easily add transcripts. By clicking the **waveform button** in the toolbar, you can insert a transcription of an audio or video file directly into your document. This is particularly useful for analyzing interviews or other recordings within the context of your research.

Once you’ve uploaded a media file, Leapfrog will handle the transcription, making it easy to review and work with the transcript alongside your other notes and documents.

### 3. Note-Taking and Text Styling

You can use the document editor to take **notes** and stylize your text. Common text formatting options such as **bold**, _italic_, and `code` are available via the editor’s toolbar. This allows you to emphasize important points, keep your notes well-organized, and make your documents more readable.

### 4. Adding Quotations and Codes

In addition to writing and formatting, you can also add **quotations** and **codes** directly to your document text. This feature allows you to label specific segments of your research for deeper analysis, making it easier to track themes and insights. For more information on how to use tags like codes and quotations, check out the [Tags](./tags) page.
