The **Document Editor** in Leapfrog is a powerful tool designed to help you organize, analyze, and collaborate on your research. Whether you’re transcribing interviews, taking notes, or coding data, the editor provides a flexible and collaborative environment for your work.

## Collaborative Editing

Leapfrog is fully **collaborative**, allowing multiple users to work together in real time. You and your team can write, edit, and annotate documents simultaneously. Any changes are instantly visible to all collaborators, streamlining teamwork and enabling productive collaboration.

Your workspace dictates if someone has access to the document. If you are in a workspace, you can invite collaborators to join you in the document. Only editor and owners can view documents inside a workspace.

## Transcripts

One of the standout features of the editor is the ability to easily add transcripts. By clicking the **waveform button** in the toolbar, you can insert a transcription of an audio or video file directly into your document. This is particularly useful for analyzing interviews or other recordings within the context of your research.

Inserting a transcript will allow you to transcribe your clips. You clips can be any audio or video file, and is able to handle complex conversations and multiple speakers. See more about [transcribing](/basics/transcribing-interviews).

Once you’ve uploaded a media file, Leapfrog will handle the transcription, making it easy to review and work with the transcript alongside your other notes and documents.

## Note-Taking and Text Styling

You can use the document editor to take **notes** and stylize your text. Common text formatting options such as **bold**, _italic_, and `code` are available via the editor’s toolbar. This allows you to emphasize important points, keep your notes well-organized, and make your documents more readable.

## Document Fields

Document fields are customizable attributes that can be added to your documents at the workspace level. These fields allow you to add structured metadata to your documents, making it easier to organize, filter, and analyze your research materials. Each document in a workspace inherits all document fields defined for that workspace.

#### Types of Document Fields

1. **Text**: For short text entries like keywords or categories.
2. **Number**: For numerical data such as participant IDs or ratings.
3. **Date**: For recording important dates related to your research.
4. **Switch**: For binary (yes/no) information.

#### Adding and Using Document Fields

Document fields are created at the workspace level by workspace administrators. Once created, these fields appear in all documents within the workspace. You can fill in these fields for each document to add relevant metadata. When importing documents into a canvas, you can use these fields as tags for easy organization and filtering.

By effectively using document fields, you can add an extra layer of organization to your research, making it easier to manage large amounts of data and extract meaningful insights from your documents.

### 5. Adding Quotations and Codes

In addition to writing and formatting, you can also add **quotations** and **codes** directly to your document text. This feature allows you to label specific segments of your research for deeper analysis, making it easier to track themes and insights.
