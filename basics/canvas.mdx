# Canvas

Canvasses are visual spaces where you can brainstorm or map out relationships between different pieces of information. You can use canvasses to create a visual overview of your research data and identify patterns and insights that might not have been obvious otherwise.

The **canvas** in Leapfrog is inspired by tools commonly used by creatives, but with a key difference—it’s powered by **source-truth data**. This makes it a powerful tool for qualitative research, enabling you to analyze data at scale and leverage AI models to uncover insights.

## Creating a Canvas

To create a new canvas, you need to be in a **workspace**. Each workspace can contain multiple canvasses.

1. Navigate to your workspace.
2. Click the **New Canvas** button located in the top right corner of your screen.
3. A blank canvas will open, ready for you to start adding data and organizing information.

## Adding Ground-Truth Data to a Canvas

Once your canvas is created, you can add various elements to visualize and structure your research data. Below are the ways to populate your canvas.

### 1. Add Data from Your Documents

You can easily add data from your existing Leapfrog documents.

- Click the **Add Data** button on the canvas toolbar.
- Select relevant documents or quotes and drag them onto the canvas.
- Each piece of data becomes a **data node** that can be freely manipulated within the space.

### 2. Import Data from Dovetail

Leapfrog integrates with Dovetail, allowing you to import data from your Dovetail projects.

- Click **Import** in the toolbar.
- Select **Import from Dovetail**.
- Choose the appropriate project and data, which will be added as **data nodes** on your canvas.

### 3. Import Data from a CSV

You can also import CSV files into the canvas:

- Select **Import CSV** from the toolbar.
- Upload your CSV file. The data will be converted into interactive nodes, which you can tag, organize, and analyze.

## Using the Canvas

The canvas is a collaborative, flexible space where you can analyze data and generate insights. You can work with a variety of elements to build relationships and highlight key themes.

### Elements on the Canvas

- **Data Nodes**: These are the individual pieces of information, such as quotes or insights, added from documents or CSV imports. Data nodes are the building blocks for organizing and analyzing research data.
- **Text Elements**: You can add custom text elements to label parts of your canvas, make notes, or provide context around certain data clusters.

- **Paths**: Use **paths** to draw visual connections between data nodes. This helps in mapping relationships, showing flow, or highlighting patterns.

- **Notes**: Add **notes** to any part of your canvas. Notes allow you to annotate specific data points or connections, providing additional context or insights.

- **Themes**: A **theme** is a container that holds related notes. Themes can be manually created to group insights, or they are automatically generated when you use AI-powered clustering to organize data. Themes provide a structured way to examine recurring concepts or patterns.

### AI Integrations

Leapfrog’s canvas is enhanced with AI-driven tools that allow you to cluster and extract insights from your research data.

#### Clustering

AI-powered clustering helps group related data nodes based on common themes. When you cluster, Leapfrog will analyze the data and automatically group similar pieces of information. A **theme** will also be created for each cluster, holding notes that explain the pattern.

#### Insight Extraction

Using Leapfrog's AI models, you can extract actionable insights directly from your data. This tool analyzes the relationships between data nodes and helps identify key themes, making it easier to derive conclusions from large datasets.
